% Now, you need to run the following python code from the gpdinc directory:
%
% python generate_lmdbs.py CAFFEfiles 0 15
% python generate_nets.py CAFFEfiles
% python train_lenet.py CAFFEfiles
%
% These python files are a mess, but they should work. I'll try to fix them
% soon.
% 
% At this point, you should be able to look at solver_results.txt and
% view accuracy on the test set as a function of training iteration.
